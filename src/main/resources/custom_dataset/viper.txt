[Intro]
Haha
Here's a little something for you busta's
Yeah

[Chorus]
What's up with that?
You'll cowards don't even smoke crack
What's up with that?
You'll cowards don't even smoke crack

[Verse 1]
Hater, you, don't even smoke crack, bitch, you's a mark fool
Motherfuck that ho shit, pass a G that stem
I'm about to blaze up, 'specially when it's after dinner
I changed the game don't get it misunderstood
Hitting it out the glass and that smoke all good
Can't water it with green, get work, got that stick
Laws know I keep it, they on my dick, these niggas sick
But when I do smoke some weed
I'm straight out that rose, you best believe
But green ain't better than that hard, hard is so much fun
Seven for forty-five, wholesale gets it done
And I don't care if you judge me
I'm smoking cooked, and living so lovely
So stop looking like you're dumb
You know you wanna try, but fail to get some

[Hook]
What's up with that?
You'll cowards don't even smoke crack
What's up with that?
You'll cowards don't even smoke crack
What's up with that?
You'll cowards don't even smoke crack
What's up with that?
You'll cowards don't even smoke crack

[Verse 2]
It's on an' poppin'
I'm blazing white, now my destiny ain't stopping
I'm coming up in a song to rap
I sold my soul to Satan but bought it back from God with this song
Y'all bustas ain't ballin
Until you smoke some work and see who really paper calling
Y'all falling off like the last century
No respect from me till you get that cheese
And you see what life is all about
Till then you just a little bitch with a raised snout
I gets my clout from the mainstream
It's always love and dap in my dope scene
I'm clowning, and keeping it rock
My coke chopped and screwed cause I'm on the block
I'm stinging big and bringing work
All the while keeping y'all haters feelings hurt

[Hook]
What's up with that?
You'll cowards don't even smoke crack
What's up with that?
You'll cowards don't even smoke crack
What's up with that?
You'll cowards don't even smoke crack
What's up with that?
You'll cowards don't even smoke crack

[Hook]
What's up, I don't give a fuck
If boys run up, I'll be quick to bust
What's up, I don't give a fuck
If boys run up, I'll be quick to bust
What's up, I don't give a fuck
If boys run up, I'll be quick to bust
What's up, I don't give a fuck
If boys run up, I'll be quick to bust

[Verse 1]
This is Southwest rolling in
Ready to bust time and time again
I'll let these boys know from the start
None of these cowards got no heart
I gotta throw it out there, for all y'all
These are no contact, like baseball
They wouldn't do nothing, even if I enticed ya
Cause these bullets'll slice ya
Up, like a knife
Ten seconds later (later), you lost your life
All for looking for a quick comeup
But they still got ya done up
I got my gun up, ready to bust
In lead I trust, I'll put these boys in the dust
It's time to take a little trip
But you ain't coming back, cause bitch you slipped

[Hook]
What's up, I don't give a fuck
If boys run up, I'll be quick to bust
What's up, I don't give a fuck
If boys run up, I'll be quick to bust
What's up, I don't give a fuck
If boys run up, I'll be quick to bust
What's up, I don't give a fuck
If boys run up, I'll be quick to bust

[Verse 2]
Watch how I ride
Ho-ass niggas know it's homicide
When you're just a beginner,
Shoot you in the throat with the pull up, nigga
Getting under their skin
I don't ball blanks
After I smoke 'em, I wonder who's next
Aiming at necks, like a guillotine
Tell these bitch niggas I hustle for lean
I roll by, looking clean
With the coldest piece and chain that you ever seen
Right before your lights get dimmed
After you're hit by the 9mm
Your head explodes
Like a plastic bottle left in the road
Something 'bout you looking dead look tight
Adrenaline got you too high

[Hook]
What's up, I don't give a fuck
If boys run up, I'll be quick to bust
What's up, I don't give a fuck
If boys run up, I'll be quick to bust
What's up, I don't give a fuck
If boys run up, I'll be quick to bust
What's up, I don't give a fuck
If boys run up, I'll be quick to bust

My hops
They wanna see me gone cause of my hops
Shot in the dome cause of my hops
And fallin' on four cause of my hops
My hops
They wanna see me sprained cause of my hops
And sleeping in a grave cause of my hops
And not getting paid 'cause of my hops

[Verse 1]
Ballers know the deal when they see me in the place
Follow up, two hand dunk
Nuts in ya face
See, you was under the goal
Where the big boys play
So now you know
I'm 6'2 with crazy hops
From that two-hand in my video
I'm still gettin props
Like me, I wear a size 10
That's why I'm gettin' bucked time and time again
Boys look like they wanna squabble
When they see me snow-bird
'Cause they know they gonna get a 2 hand reverse!
Or I might just do a self alley...
And hang on the rim until your posse wanna blast me
Yeah, that's how I do
On this hoop court, I'm a fool
And I'm still getting up
To get the whole place crunk

[Hook]
My hops
They wanna see me gone cause of my hops
Shot in the dome cause of my hops
And fallin' on four cause of my hops
My hops
They wanna see me sprained cause of my hops
And sleeping in a grave cause of my hops
And not getting paid 'cause of my hops

[Verse 2]
I'm paid, I gives a fuck about a win
I'm trying to get me a nasty bandit
A loss I dont par—
I leave the court and get freaked by three stars
That's the life of a G
My hoop shorts too long to ever see a knee
White or black t-shirt
That's a bet
And I'm always dry, 'cause real ballers never sweat
Damn, a thug got game
I could've hooped in the pros
But motherfuck a play
And boys know where I be
Marian ballin, is where to find me
Hooping on a Thursday night
Rising to the occasion, and taking type flight
And oh yeah, I got that thang with me
Under the bleachers you'll do a 360

[Hook]
My hops
They wanna see me gone cause of my hops
Shot in the dome cause of my hops
And fallin' on four cause of my hops
My hops
They wanna see me sprained cause of my hops
And sleeping in a grave cause of my hops
And not getting paid 'cause of my hops
My hops
They wanna see me gone cause of my hops
Shot in the dome cause of my hops
And fallin' on four cause of my hops
My hops
They wanna see me sprained cause of my hops
And sleeping in a grave cause of my hops
And not getting paid 'cause of my hops
My hops

I'm a snake
And when you hear 'em talkin' 'bout snakes
They talkin' 'bout me
I'm a snake
And when you hear 'em sneakin' on snakes
They sneakin' bout me
I'm a snake
And when you hear 'em talkin' 'bout snakes
They talkin' 'bout me
I'm a snake
And when you hear 'em sneakin' on snakes
They sneakin' on me

[Verse 1]
Makin' more money than I ever made, this year
Got the hoes up shinin' like a chandelier
When bad chicks see me, I get cheers
And when haters see me they disappear
This my swag that make sure they stay out it
And it my money that make sure they leave rowdy
I dont give a care how I rise
Past the top level cause my cash traumatise
Yeah, sail ships so I keep my mouth shut
Meanwhile you done snitchin' tight
They keep theyself in a rut
As I'm all cashed up, gleaned up
From head to toe
And now your whole team know
This power blanger roll
I'm wrapped in green, I'm a snake in the grass
And it keep haters mugs mean, here's a test
I'm some lifesaver, with just a little work
Hand down to heaven, God bless we got a curse

[Hook]
I'm a snake
And when you hear 'em talkin' 'bout snakes
They talkin' 'bout me
I'm a snake
And when you hear 'em sneakin' on snakes

I'm a snake
And when you hear 'em talkin' 'bout snakes
They talkin' 'bout me
I'm a snake
And when you hear 'em sneakin' on snakes
They sneakin' on me

[Verse 2]
Gon' keep it real, in your heart you's a coward
Claimin' that you know, when you ain't got no power
I don't trust you, I think ya jankin'
And when I call your demise, the world might thank me
I close, click, done, makin 6 G's up
I start thuggin', makin' teams freeze up
Finding deep in the club, mall swag stylin'
365 24/7 pro ballin'
I'm guaranteed to win, I got win on lock
While square rappers wearin' pieces shaped like a box
Meanwhile I'm laughing at that thing
As they say I'm the realest with the realest piece an' chain
Thinking to myself "Will my realness ever end?"
But it won't cause when I die later, they'll wake me up again
Money keep comin' hour after hour
I'm street certified to keep you haters lookin' sour

[Hook]
I'm a snake
And when you hear 'em talkin' 'bout snakes
They talkin' 'bout me
I'm a snake
And when you hear 'em sneakin' on snakes
They sneakin' bout me
I'm a snake
And when you hear 'em talkin' 'bout snakes
They talkin' 'bout me
I'm a snake
And when you hear 'em sneakin' on snakes
They sneakin' on me

[Chorus]
You gon' die
You fucked up, I drive by
You can't slide
If it was me it wouldn't ride
You gon' die
You fucked up, I drive by
You can't slide
If it was me it wouldn't ride

[Verse 1]
Motherfucker, thought your sawed-off would split me
But I was ready when you tried to come and get me
It was real though, you gave it a try
But I saw your bitch ass out the corner of my eye
I saw you comin' fast, in the black cap
Nigga, 'cause I heard that
You wanted to smoke, because your ego got sexy
When you heard I called you, I'm walkin' around
I got your willy
But that shit just small
You goin' down on your mom like a whore
But what you ain't know, I was ready for what was next
When you spin, 'round the corner
You ain't know I already had everything set up on ya
My nigga, I'll box you in, and put that bag over your head
So you don't know what's happening

[Chorus]
You gon' die
You fucked up, I drive by
You can't slide
If it was me it wouldn't ride
You gon' die

[Verse 2]
Now I got yo' bitch ass in my penthouse
With that bag over your head, now what you talkin' 'bout?
Straight beatin' that ass, makin' sure that you know, I'm about to blast
You gon' die, in layman's terms
You willy killer, and get yourself burnt
But don't worry, it won't be much more pain
'Cause I'm about to put this bullet, inside your brain
Now tell me, how does it feel, to know that you's about to get killed
And to know, that you made a fatal choice
To test the G, that keeps the most
So die bumhole , and say your last words
'Cause this gon' be the last shit that you ever heard
Now weep, this was your life
Watch this shit blast, in front of your eyes

[Chorus]
You gon' die
You fucked up, I drive by
You can't slide
If it was me it wouldn't ride
You gon' die
You fucked up, I drive by
You can't slide
If it was me it wouldn't ride
You gon' die

Gunshots

[Verse 1]
You don't wanna hear what's singin'
Gunshots bangin' out...
When you're comin'
And I promise, it's gone get ya runnin'
Gunshots roar out like a lion
We'll get these bitch boys cryin'
They better beware...
I stay prepared
A band of plugs sound out the coil...
If these boys try to get my spoil
The noise gone make 'em think twice about
Tryin' to catch a baller for things he sacrificed...for
So I can't lay down...
I gotta put you on the ground
Real quick like...
As I let these take flight

[Hook]
Gunshots...
I ball for...
Gunshots...

[Verse 2]
If I have to, I'll catch 'em off guard
Sound hit after the bullet, but still go hard
It's like the volume guys
Every time I pop my nine
The power of the heat, the man's respect
And it's fast to put...these boys in check
You might hear it out the Tec
Except these ain't a lec...ture
It's you dyin', muthafucka
And goin' out like a sucka
Naan nigga needed-
Just me and my index get the place heated
And you win...
Gunshots and you use the med
Time for sleepin'
For these stains I was peepin'

[Hook]
Gunshots...
I ball for...
Gunshots...

Hey, maybe one day you'll see me
Hey, maybe one day you'll see me
Hey, maybe one day you'll see me
Hey, maybe one day you'll see me

[Verse 1]
I won't forget about us
I was a full time thug
But every day
You gone through my mug
There's something about you I can't shake
All the years you've known me all the troubles we've made
I still call you every day and send a text at night
One day we'll hook up again, and everything gone be tight
See these boys like jealous' cause the cash I stack
They want me gone from you forever, and sleeping on my back
But that ain't gon' happen
We gone both keep getting paid and I'm gone keep rapping
We'dve finally made it
And we can't be faded
Life is great, and I'll be thinking of you
And all the things we used to do
Like always holding hands when we roll in my cars
And going camping, looking up at the stars

[Hook]
Hey, maybe one day you'll see me
Hey, maybe one day you'll see me
Hey, maybe one day you'll see me
Hey, maybe one day you'll see me

[Verse 2]
At first, things ain't go as planned
But you kept it real with me
And one day I can, I'll be your man
And make all your dreams come true
Remember, I was always proud of you
I know sometimes I can't carry myself the way I should act
But I was born a thug, and that's just that
But every day, I'm a better man
And for our future, I got a nice plan
You and me forever, no more I'll be stunting
Our pockets very cool and in that RV you want
I'll take you round on trips, across the world
I won't break your heart, you're my only girl
I'm gon' make your life so perfect
So you can tell your friends, show out and splurge it
So when you say your prayers at night
Remember me, I got your back for life

[Hook]
Hey, maybe one day you'll see me
Hey, maybe one day you'll see me
Hey, maybe one day you'll see me
Hey, maybe one day you'll see me
Hey, maybe one day you'll see me
Hey, maybe one day you'll see me
Hey, maybe one day you'll see me
Hey, maybe one day you'll see me

They saying I'm unique
Cause I sell the best cocaine on the streets
It's bout me they tell you it's A1
I sell the best coke, holla when you want some
They saying I'm unique
Cause I sell the best cocaine on the streets
It's bout me they tell you it's A1

[Verse 1]
I sell the best jay
Smoke it with me
Top grade cocaine
I still sell the sticky
Powder so killer
Swear after one hit
It will make you and yo gal wanna groove it
World class powder
Straight from Colombia
Put it on everything
My coke will numb ya
Certified to be tha best
You ever had
Don’t forget about the horse
'cause it’s gon' keep you glad
My coke so gravy
Otha dealers jealous
When they pushin’ up daisies
Cause they dope
Inferior to mine
HIT ME UP
Imma have you on cloud nine
Link up with your thug
If you ain't scarin'
You gon' fall in love
And my cocaine ….. (?)
I like my competition
Ain't no attitude
Ice-cold
Uncut
Viper, they mad at him

[Verse 2]
Call in when you buyin'

My customers stay happy
They keep saying that
I'm the realest
Dope boy that ever lived
'cause all to the dope game I give
My top grade cocaine
You hit it once and it's locked off in your brain
You will float to a new plane
And we ain’t afraid to shoot, take a shot to the vein
Coward people out there
Time to go home
'Cause it’s time to take a hit
Go to another zone
I'm your dope man
But I’ll take a hit with ya
So you can see it's safe and accept the big picture
Cocaine is the movement
Judgemental cowards just gotta do it
Ain't no B-boys beating my prices
And if your money low then my price I'll slice it
Choose me
When you work and relax
I sell powder I sell crack
My work is something like you never experienced
One small sniff on my line you can feel it in
My twenty-packs lovely
Have you up all day
Haters jealous of me
Because they know I sell the best jay
Never caught a dope case
Cause I got the best goods
Customers don't snitch cause I sell the best in tha hood

[Hook]
They saying I'm unique
Cause I sell the best cocaine on the streets
It's bout me they tell you it's A1
I sell the best coke, holla when you want some
They saying I'm unique

It's bout me they tell you it's A1

Uh-oh

Now these boys wishin' that I was in bad health
Models choosin' up
Like I'm the last man on Earth
Meanwhile, I got these boys feelings hurt
Tall pretty nigga it ain't fair I got it all
Killer hops, with cash to blow up a mall
Life ain't fair for y'all
So just watch me ball
Will you be a hater like folks that wanna see me fall?
I hope they all stall
Just watch my new ride crawl
Holla' at me at the whole court for a hoop call
Bring yo homies even if they can't stand me
Just don't take it personal when I get that grammy

I'm waiting for them to make a new Lambo body style
These niggas riding around the same old body style as '05
How did these nothing rappers get deals and even think they rippin'
No need to answer that cause I'm rich so I ain't trippin'
Getting [?] got me lookin' towards beef
Test this and you'll be cold beef in the streets
I'm a magician when it comes to that pistol play
Make you disappear and reappear dead a different day
Ok
Keep me playin' in this money
You boys broke as a joke
That damn funny
I'm something more than a balla'
Ask around about me and and find out I'm that top malla'
I'm somethin' like a baker
Flippin' pizza bread
And tryin' to keep all of this dough from going to my head
That's a triple rhyme
Did you hear what I said
Don't get high on your own supply
Lesson one of street cred

[Hook: Viper]
Crazy cash

I wanna sleep me a nigga
I wanna murder me a figure
I'mma ball through, all so player
The one malla to mash on these haters

[Verse 1]
I'mma stang licks and I'm gon' chill
I'mma be the one, they pray who blood get spilled
9 milli clipped up, ready to clown
Chain hangin', catch me fallin' through midtown
Word around town j-j-j-jealous of my chain piece
If they reach for it, on my life they gon' meet they G
Rap's best medallion got these hoe-ass niggas jealous
If you try to block my shine I'm killing you and your fella
You broke-ass fools ain't making nan penny
So you wanna hate on me, 'cause I'm making plenty?
That's some bitch shit, nigga you should know better
But since you don't, pussy bitch, your shirt gon' get wetter
You mark-ass niggas don't fight no more
'Cause if you did, on my bitch I'd drop you to the floor
These marks gon' respect my hustle
If they don't we gon' square up and tussle
Take this shit to another zone
Pistol play, iron it out with the chrome

[Hook]
I wanna sleep me a nigga
I wanna murder me a figure
I wanna sleep me a nigga
I wanna murder me a figure

[Verse 2]
These rappers piece 'n' chains look like trash
On the coup look like them got 'em outta garbage bags
Man that shit there make me laugh
Now I understand why my bitch so bad
'Cause bad bitches won't fuck with niggas like that
These yellow-gold ass niggas lookin' like doormats
They wearin' yellow 'cause they yellow, scary cats
Nigga get some white gold and take that bullshit back
Do I gotta teach you dumb rappers everything?
Nothing motherfuckers, go buy some white gold rings

[Chorus]
You gone die..
You fucked off my drive-by
It can't slide...
If it was me it wouldn't ride...
[x2]


Mothafucka thought yo sawed off could split me
But I was ready when you tried to come and get me
It was real though you gave it a try
But I saw yo bitch ass out the corna of my eye
I saw you comin' fast in the black, lac
And I knew what was up, cuz I heard that
You wanted to smoke me cuz yo ego got tapped
When you heard I called you, a mark and a rap
I got you now mark you tried to resolve
But that shit you shot, really wasn't nothin
You rolled down ya windows, and you throwed your flex
But what you ain't know, I was ready for what was next
When you slid round the corna...
You ain't know I already had everythang set up one ya
My niggas all box you in
And put that bag ova ya head so you ain't know what's happenin

[Chorus]

Now I got yo bitchass in my warehouse
With that bag ova ya heard now whatchu talkin bout
Straight beatin that ass
Makin sure, that you know, im about to blassst
You gone die, in layman's terms
You was fuckin widda killa, and got yoself burned
But don't worry, won't be much more pain
Cuz I'm about to put this bullet, inside ya brain
Now tell me, how does it feel?
To know, that you's about to get killed
And to know, that, you made a fatal choice
To test the G, that keeps the most
So gone, and say your last words
Cuz this gone be the last shit that u eva heard
Now peep
This was yo life
Watch this shit flasssh
In front of yo eyes

[Chorus]

Now I'm out here tryna bang bang

So they can gold name brand me
The realest of the grind, can you stand me?
I'm tryna hit it , a major win
With checks going out, and mo' pourin' in
And I'ma do this 'till they brand me
So tell me will they stand me

[Verse 1]

I don't pay dues fall night time
It's been a hype minute, I been hustlin for miles
Sittin on the bench from comfortable to pain
Waitin for fate to push a malla over the game
It's like I see the prize in the distance
So my grind ain't allowin nothing but persistance
I still ball late, don't get it twisted
? have my people say they miss this
They say ? I'm the realest
?
Imagine these haters ?
They say ? I'm the realest
My swag ?

[Chorus]
Now I'm out here tryna bang bang
I won't stop 'till Viper is a household name
So they can gold name brand me
The realest of the grind, can you stand me?
I'm tryna hit it , a major win
With [?] , and mo' pourin' in
And I'ma do this 'till they brand me
So tell me will they stand me


[Verse 2]
Goal after goal I'm gettin mo paper
Stain after stain, I'm gettin mo haters

I gots to ball
I can not fall
I gots to ball
I can't fall

[Verse 1]
I'm gon' keep winning for real
I'm loving this like my drop Lac on twenty inch wheels
Just hopped off the new Lex on things
My Lamborghini doors open like chicken wings
But I never touch the steering wheel of my Bentley
'Cause when I ride that, my chauffeurette come get me
In my house I got thirteen maids
Seven from the motherland and six from Spain
These ladies straight take care of they thug
Massages, bath sex, showers and back rubs
What... can a baller say?
Sometimes I just chill and don't leave for days
Gettin' freaked while watchin' my ninety inch flatscreen
Ring a bell for ten more girls, are checkin' to see
If they G need huggin'
Warm touching, or old fashion fuckin'

[Hook]
I gots to ball
I can not fall
I gots to ball
I can't fall

[Verse 2]
My Maserati go hard
Indoor and outdoor court in my backyard
Every race, of female I'm housin'
My pool big enough to fit one thousand
So why did I get that Navi?
So I can freak it out, like my Escalade caddy
And that there bump...
Put the box in the back and let it thump 'ot the trunk
Appetizer puts me in an eatin' mood
My cook peepin me 'ot, as she makes my food
But this time I don't like the meal
She come to kiss me and say she love me still
How many cars does one G need?
I don't know and I don't care 'cause I got the green
Security cameras on my house, no burglar bars
'Cause I keep more heat than a day on Mars

[Hook] x 2
I gots to ball
I can not fall
I gots to ball
I can't fall

Yeah, I'm making them commas
Call my daddy house, six-six figures to my momma
Yeah, I'm touchin' that maddy(?)
Call the same house, six-six figures to my daddy
Yeah, I'm making them commas
Call my daddy house, six-six figures to my momma
Yeah, I'm touchin' that maddy(?)
Call the same house, six-six figures to my daddy

[Verse]
I had to lay something down for my people
When it comes to mom and daddy, there's no equal
Daddy was a preacher, momma was a principal
He never spared the wrong, and for that I am thankful
Church four times a week, taught me deep rooted values
Tenets of humility to this very day I use
We didn't have much, just a house and the standard shoes
But thank the Lord our clothes was new
Never had to wear 'em used
Every blue moon some might be name brand
So you was happy for whatever you can - come across
'Cause our daddy and momma - had money tight
Sometimes it brought them drama
Mom [?]
Daddy collection to collection(?)
Never tripped cause none of his dreams would come to fruition
Cause he sacrificed for his sons and my sisters
To make sure we had a childhood we could remember
And respect and we could cherish
And recollect if we grew to perish
Momma had me in her thirties, Daddy had me older
Now he in his golden years, a striped up soldier
[?] sacrificed
Dropped out of med school so she could raise us
The way she thought was right
So she instilled in all of us to be doctors
And one actually did
My sister and her husband
The rest of us did our own thing
I got into rap and the real-estate game
My brother next to me got into movie producing
Hit some [?], now that man ain't losin'
My little sister and my brother next to my oldest
[?] holdin'
My oldest sister knew him good
Making money with executive assistants soon
The only one I don't know bout my biggest brother Ronnie
I wish I knew where he was, I wish he'd come and find me
I heard he north of me, but I don't really know
I wanna find him so bad, it burns a hole in my soul
I wish I could write him
Last time I seen him I was a toddler in diapers
I never dreamed that we would be split apart
Now I got a big tear in the middle of my heart
Ronnie if you're listening come find out where I'm at, yo
I'm thinking bout you daily and missing you like crazy, bro
I'm telling you I love you with all of my heart
And you best believe that they lovin' them from the start
And cross the other side, I will see you if I don't here
We gon' catch up and we gon' rejoice and cheer
In the platinum gates of Heaven's ghetto
And we gon' get to choose how it's gon' go
Ain't gon' be no hatin, plus a walk-through ceiling
Top choice work and plenty bad women
Pretty good drink, pretty good drugs
No coke, [?] juries, ain't gonna be no judge
Ronnie, do you have a Facebook or Twitter? (No!)
None of my blood, flesh of my flesh, I miss you so
Therefore, before I leave this place behind me
Oldest bro, Ronnie, come and find me!

[Hook]
Yeah, I'm making them commas(?)
Call my daddy house, six-six figures to my momma
Yeah, I'm touchin' that maddy(?)
Call the same house, six-six figures to my daddy
Yeah, I'm making them commas(?)
Call my daddy house, six-six figures to my momma
Yeah, I'm touchin' that maddy(?)
Call the same house, six-six figures to my daddy

Don't get sent home
In a body bag for not leaving me alone
I don't care what you got goin on
Cuz i already paid and my body is every bone
Yea i know, that I'm conceited and arrogant
And that can be repeated
But that's just my personality
And it's magnified cuz im a G
So i ain't trying to hear what they gotta say
Like they ? for a jack, so i ? the gun spray
These marks are fucking up my day
Rollin up asking if they may
Ask me a question about some bullshit
Bitch ass nigga you better get a grip
I'm tired of playing with these faggots
I'm bout to get my four and let you snitch niggas have it

I roll on my own
My homeboys sad they walks and rome
Around upset
In a rush to get wet
Why do you wanna die
Don't you see, living is fly?
Don't make your folk cry
And have niggas looking at your frame
Closed eyes
I ball and mash
No room in pockets
They full of cash
My task
Is to make dough
Im getting loot from places i ain't seen before
Or knew existed
A baller stuck on a mission
But wondering when this green gon' stop coming in
I'll go…

It be that baller out the best side
Everything's cool, and everything alright
I don't give a fuck, nigga you'll be dead
For running up fast, not peeping out what I said
It be that baller out the best side
Everything's cool, and everything's alright
I don't give a fuck, nigga you'll be dead
For running up fast, not peeping out what I said

[Verse 1]
It's that slanger, the one you can't get with
The one who hustles is priceless
As I breathe, and don't slip
And these boys want me on the dead tip
..Literally..
But that ain't happening
My cash got me a elated
And it got these boys frustrated
Yeah, I know you're upset, but don't let your anger get you wet
Cause if you cross the line
I won't hesitate to shoot you one time
And catch you in the forehead
And see how much your skull bled
From them hollowpoints..
If you try to take my joints

[Hook]
It be that baller out the best side
Everything cool, and everything alright
I don't give a fuck, nigga you'll be dead

I don't give a fuck, nigga you'll be dead
For running up fast, not peeping out what I said

[Verse 2]
This is how I do, boys
Lookin' actin' like they scheming on me too
I don't understand why they don't see i'm focused on every plan ..That's devised to break me apart
But I can't lose, you knew that from the start
All the barricades only wastes your time
Cause i'm still stuck on win, on my grind
And can't no-one stop it
Just like the money in my pockets, can't nobody hock it
My hustle is respectable
And my shine is impeccable
My gleam is a spectical
My nine is undetectable
I'm untestable
And your trace is unreflectable

[Hook]
It be that baller out the best side
Everything cool, and everything alright
I don't give a fuck, nigga you'll be dead
For running up fast, not peeping out what I said
It be that baller out the best side
Everything cool, and everything alright
I don't give a fuck, nigga you'll be dead
For running up fast, not peeping out what I said

[Verse 1]
I'm waiting for the day I can take a nigga life
And when I do, I promise I'll think twice
Bitch-ass niggas, I let 'em know from the jump
Run your ass up and you're gonna see the pump
And I keep with me the slugs
Ready to pop one of these punks in the mud
I'm watching them like an eagle watches prey
Waiting to catch the first jump and say
Something, out the norm
It's pre-meditated, man mark getting warm
I roll the swarm on these boys
And let my toys make some noise
Like the poor folk own a Glock
To put these boys down on the block
I cock my hammer in position
And leave your family tears in fruition

[Hook]
Heartless
Merciless
Heartless

[Verse 2]
Motherfuckers die like it ain't shit
If I pop in the seventeen-round clip
It's the truth how these boys will fall over
And if they ain't old, I told ya
Gunshots will ring out
While tricks run north and south
But you can't run and you can't hide
When I got you in my mind for a homicide
If I gotta go to war, I'm prepared
No hunches, I don't care
'Cause if they want to go there, I swear
Your life won't be spared
I show these tricks how I do
I leave 'em without a clue
Wondering who
Left me on the ground by your .22s?

You gon' see
You dealing with a real G
A fake sense of security you got from your homie
You gon' see
You dealing with a real G
A fake sense of security you got from your homie

[Verse 1]
I don't understand these niggas
Riding with them bustas like, sis my nigga
What the fuck can another nigga do for you
But talk behind your back, dumbass fool?
But ya'll bustas steady riding packed like bitches
I can't tell if you gals, niggas, or snitches
And to top it off you're scheming on niggas riches
I hope you coming this way, cause I'm leaving you twitchin'
But it ain't just ya'll, it's other rappers too
Dick riding other rappers to get a record deal
You got other rappers nuts in your mouth like a girl
Don't ever bring a rap war to my world
Cause you gon' get defeated
And a new career you gon' be needin'
Back to working at Micky D's
And back to livin' with mommy

[Hook]
You gon' see
You dealing with a real G
A fake sense of security you got from your homie
You gon' see
You dealing with a real G
A fake sense of security you got from your homie

[Verse 2]
So my heat, stays on my shelf
For boys who ain't man enough to flow by themself
Gotta have another nigga with ya
But this nine will make both ya faggots get the picture
Split ya wig, right open and leave the coroner scopin'
How many bullets lead to your demise?
And what kind of bullet went in between your boys eyes
Suprise, bitch niggas ya'll stanking
Suprise, i'm still banking
Back to balling and making that cheese
While your taxed and smelling, pushing up daisies
Now, the stories been told
Motherfuck you and your bitchass home
Stop riding with niggas that's old news
And ride solo, fool

[Hook]
You gon' see
You dealing with a real G
A fake sense of security you got from your homie
You gon' see
You dealing with a real G
A fake sense of security you got from your homie
