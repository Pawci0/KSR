[Verse]
Fly me to the moon
Let me play among the stars
And let me see what spring is like
On a, Jupiter and Mars
In other words, hold my hand
In other words, baby, kiss me

[Chorus 1]
Fill my heart with song
And let me sing forevermore
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words, please be true
In other words, I love you

[Chorus 2]
Fill my heart with song
Let me sing forevermore
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words, please be true
In other words, in other words
I love
You

[Verse 1]
And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain
I've lived a life that's full
I traveled each and every highway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way

[Verse 2]
Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption
I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way

[Verse 3]
Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all, and I stood tall
And did it my way

[Verse 4]
I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
Oh, no, oh, no, not me
I did it my way

[Verse 5]
For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way

[Outro]
Yes, it was my way
</song>
<song>
[Verse 1]
Start spreading the news, I'm leaving today
I want to be a part of it
New York, New York
These vagabond shoes, are longing to stray
Right through the very heart of it
New York, New York
I wanna wake up in a city that doesn't sleep
And find I'm king of the hill, top of the heap
These little town blues, are melting away

[Hook 1]
I'll make a brand new start of it in old New York
If I can make it there, I'll make it anywhere
It's up to you, New York, New York

[Verse 2]
New York, New York
I want to wake up in a city that never sleeps
And find I'm a number one, top of the list
King of the hill, a number one
These little town blues, are melting away

[Hook 2]
And I'm gonna make a brand new start of it in old New York
And if I can make it there, I'm gonna make it anywhere
It's up to you, New York, New York
</song>

Some day, when I'm awfully low
When the world is cold
I will feel a glow just thinking of you
And the way you look tonight

Yes, you're lovely, with your smile so warm
And your cheeks so soft
There is nothing for me, but to love you
And the way you look tonight

With each word, your tenderness grows
Tearing my fear apart
And that laugh wrinkles your nose
Touches my foolish heart

Lovely; never, ever change
Keep that breathless charm
Won't you please arrange it? Cause I love you
Just the way you look tonight

[Instrumental]

And that laugh that wrinkles your nose
It touches my foolish heart

Lovely, Don't you ever change
Keep that breathless charm
Won't you please arrange it? Cause I love you
A-just the way you look tonight

Mm-Mm, Mm-Mm
Just the way you look tonight

[Verse 1]
I know I stand in line until you think you have the time to spend an evening with me
And if we go some place to dance, I know that there's a chance you won't be leaving with me

[Chorus 1]
Then afterwards we drop into a quiet little place and have a drink or two
And then I go and spoil it all by saying somethin' stupid like, "I love you"
I can see it in your eyes, that you despise the same old lies you heard the night before
And though it's just a line to you, for me it's true, and never seemed so right before

[Verse 2]
I practice every day to find some clever lines to say to make the meaning come through
But then I think I'll wait until the evening gets late, and I'm alone with you

[Chorus 2]
The time is right, your perfume fills my head, the stars get red, and, oh, the night's so blue
And then I go and spoil it all by saying somethin' stupid like, "I love you"


[Chorus 2]
The time is right, your perfume fills my head, the stars get red, and, oh, the night's so blue
And then I go and spoil it all by saying somethin' stupid like, "I love you"

[Outro]
"I love you"
"I love you"
"I love you"
"I love you"
"I love you"

Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away
If you can use some exotic booze, there's a bar in far Bombay
Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away

Come fly with me, let's float down to Peru
In llama land, there's a one man band, and he'll toot his flute for you
Come fly with me, let's take off in the blue

[Chorus]
Once I get you up there, where the air is rarefied
We'll just glide, starry-eyed
Once I get you up there I'll be holding you so near
You may hear angels cheer 'cause we're together

Weather wise, it's such a lovely day
Just say the words and we'll beat the birds down to Acapulco Bay
It's perfect for a flying honeymoon, they say
Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away

[Chorus]
Once I get you up there, where the air is rarefied
We'll just glide, starry-eyed
Once I get you up there I'll be holding you so near
You may hear angels cheer 'cause we're together

Weather wise, it's such a lovely day
You just say the words and we'll beat the birds down to Acapulco Bay
It's perfect for a flying honeymoon, they say
Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly
Pack up, let's fly away

[Outro]
Pack a small bag

[Verse]
I've got you under my skin
I've got you deep in the heart of me
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me
I've got you under my skin
I tried so not to give in
I said to myself, 'this affair never will go so well'
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know so well
I've got you under my skin?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'd sacrifice anything, come what might
For the sake of having you near
In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear

[Chorus 1]
"Don't you know little fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality"
But each time that I do, just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
'Cause I've got you under my skin

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I would sacrifice anything, come what might
For the sake of having you near
In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, how it yells in my ear

[Chorus 2]
"Don't you know, little fool, you never can win?
Why not use your mentality? Step up, wake up to reality"
But each time I do, just the thought of you
Makes me stop just before I begin
'Cause I've got you under my skin
Yes, I've got you, under my skin

My funny valentine
Sweet comic valentine
You make me smile with my heart
Your looks are laughable
Unphotographable
Yet you're my favourite work of art

Is your figure less than greek
Is your mouth a little weak
When you open it to speak
Are you smart?

But don't change a hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay little valentine stay
Each day is valentines day

Is your figure less than greek
Is your mouth a little weak
When you open it to speak
Are you smart?

But don't you change one hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay little valentine stay
Each day is valentines day

[Verse 1]
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
Next year all our troubles will be out of sight

[Verse 2]
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
Next year all our troubles will be miles away

[Verse 3]
Once again as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Will be near to us, once more

[Outro]
Someday soon we all will be together
If the fates allow
Until then we'll have to muddle through somehow
So have yourself a merry little Christmas now

[Verse 1]
When I was seventeen
It was a very good year
It was a very good year for small town girls
And soft summer nights
We'd hide from the lights
On the village green
When I was seventeen

[Verse 2]
When I was twenty-one
It was a very good year
It was a very good year for city girls
Who lived up the stair
With all that perfumed hair
And it came undone
When I was twenty-one

[Verse 3]
When I was thirty-five
It was a very good year
It was a very good year for blue-blooded girls
Of independent means
We'd ride in limousines
Their chauffeurs would drive
When I was thirty-five

[Verse 4]
But now the days are short
I'm in the autumn of the year
And now I think of my life as vintage wine
From fine old kegs
From the brim to the dregs
And it poured sweet and clear
It was a very good year
</song>
<song>
[Verse 1]
That's life (that's life), that's what people say
You're riding high in April, shot down in May
But I know I'm gonna change that tune
When I'm back on top, back on top in June
I said, that's life (that's life), and as funny as it may seem
Some people get their kicks
Stompin' on a dream
But I don't let it, let it get me down
Cause this fine old world it keeps spinning around

[Chorus]
I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet
A pawn and a king
I've been up and down and over and out
And I know one thing:
Each time I find myself flat on my face
I pick myself up and get back in the race

[Verse 2]
That's life (that's life), I tell ya, I can't deny it
I thought of quitting, baby
But my heart just ain't gonna buy it
And if I didn't think it was worth one single try
I'd jump right on a big bird and then I'd fly

[Chorus]
I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate
A poet, a pawn and a king
I've been up and down and over and out
And I know one thing:
Each time I find myself laying flat on my face
I just pick myself up and get back in the race

[Verse 3]
That's life, that's life
And I can't deny it
Many times I thought of cutting out but my heart won't buy it
But if there's nothing shaking come here this July
I'm gonna roll myself up in a big ball and die
My, my
</song>

Blue moon, you saw me standin' alone
Without a dream in my heart, without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me sayin' a prayer for
Someone I really could care for

And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will hold
I heard somebody whisper "please adore me"
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold

Blue moon, now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper "please adore me"
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold

Blue moon, now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

Blue moon, now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
</song>
<song>
You make me feel so young
You make me feel so spring has sprung
And every time I see you grin
I'm such a happy individual

The moment that you speak
I wanna go play hide-and-seek
I wanna go and bounce the moon
Just like a toy balloon

You and I are just like a couple of tots
Running across the meadow
Picking up lots of forget-me-nots

You make me feel so young
You make me feel there are songs to be sung
Bells to be rung and a wonderful fling to be flung

And even when I'm old and gray
I'm gonna feel the way I do today
Cause you make me feel so young

You make me feel so young
You make me feel so spring has sprung
And every time I see you grin
I'm such a happy individual

The moment that you speak
I wanna go play hide-and-seek
I wanna go and bounce the moon
Just like a toy balloon

You and I are just like a couple of tots
Running across the meadow
Picking up lots of forget-me-nots

You make me feel so young
You make me feel there are songs to be sung
And bells to be rung
And a wonderful fling to be flung

And even when I'm old and gray
I'm gonna feel the way I do today
Cause you, you make me feel so young
You make me feel so young
You make me feel so young
Ooh, you make me feel so young

Strangers in the night exchanging glances
Wondering in the night, what were the chances?
We'd be sharing love before the night was through

Something in your eyes was so inviting
Something in your smile was so exciting
Something in my heart told me I must have you

Strangers in the night
Two lonely people, we were strangers in the night
Up to the moment when we said our first hello, little did we know
Love was just a glance away, a warm embracing dance away and

Ever since that night we've been together
Lovers at first sight, in love forever
It turned out so right for strangers in the night

[Instrumental-first three lines of Chorus]
Love was just a glance away, a warm embracing dance away

Ever since that night we've been together
Lovers at first sight, in love forever
It turned out so right for strangers in the night

Dooby-doooby-doo and other scat to end
</song>

They call you lady luck
But there is room for doubt
At times you have a very un-lady-like way
Of running out
Your on this date with me
The pickin's have been lush
And yet before the evening is over
You might give me the brush
You might forget your manners
You might refuse to stay
And so the best that I can do is pray
Luck be lady tonight
Luck be lady tonight
Luck if you've been a lady to begin with
Luck be a lady tonight
Luck let a gentleman see
Just how nice a dame you can be
I know the way you've treated other guys you've been with
Luck be a lady with me
A lady never leaves her escort
It isn't fair, it isn't nice
A lady doesn't wander all over the room
And blow on some other guys dice
Lets keep this party polite
Never get out of my sight
Stick with me baby, I'm the guy that you came in with
Luck be lady tonight
A lady never flirts with strangers
She'd have a heart, she'd be nice
A lady doesn't wander all over the room
And blow on some other guys dice
Lets keep this party polite
Never get out of my sight
Stick with me baby, I'm the guy that you came in with
Luck be lady tonight

[Part 1]
The falling leaves
Drift by the window
The autumn leaves
Of red and gold
I see your lips
The summer kisses
The sunburned hands
I used to hold
Since you went away
The days grow long
And soon I'll hear
Old winter's song
But I miss you most of all
My darling
When autumn leaves
Start to fall
</song>
<song>
[Verse]
In the wee small hours of the morning
While the whole wide world is fast asleep
You lie awake and think about the girl
And never, ever think of counting sheep

[Chorus]
When your lonely heart has learned its lesson
You'd be hers if only she would call
In the wee small hours of the morning
That's the time you miss her most of all

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
When your lonely heart has learned its lesson
You'd be hers if only she would call
In the wee small hours of the morning
That's the time you miss her most of all

Next time you're found, with your chin on the ground
There a lot to be learned, so look around

Just what makes that little old ant
Think he'll move that rubber tree plant
Anyone knows an ant, can't
Move a rubber tree plant

But he's got high hopes, he's got high hopes
He's got high apple pie, in the sky hopes

So any time you're gettin' low
'stead of lettin' go
Just remember that ant
Oops there goes another rubber tree plant

When troubles call, and your back's to the wall
There a lot to be learned, that wall could fall

Once there was a silly old ram
Thought he'd punch a hole in a dam
No one could make that ram, scram
He kept buttin' that dam

Cause he had high hopes, he had high hopes
He had high apple pie, in the sky hopes

So any time you're feelin' bad
'stead of feelin' sad
Just remember that ram
Oops there goes a billion kilowatt dam

All problems just a toy balloon
They'll be bursted soon
They're just bound to go pop
Oops there goes another problem kerplop
</song>
<song>
Why do I do just as you say
Why must I just give you your way
Why do I sigh
Why don't I try to forget

It must have been that something lovers call fate
Kept me saying "I had to wait"
I saw them all
Just couldn't fall 'til we met

It had to be you
It had to be you
I wandered around
And finally found
The somebody who
Could make me be true

And could make me be blue
And even be glad
Just to be sad
Thinking of you

Some others I've seen
Might never been mean
Might never be crossed
Or try to be bossed
But they wouldn't do

For nobody else
Gave me a thrill
With all your faults
I love you still
It had to be you
Wonderful you
It had to be you

For nobody else
Gave me a thrill
With all your faults
I love you still
It had to be you
Wonderful you
It had to be you
</song>
<song>
Out of the tree of life I just picked me a plum
You came along and everything's startin' to hum
Still, it's a real good bet, the best is yet to come

Best is yet to come and babe, won't that be fine?
You think you've seen the sun, but you ain't seen it shine

A-Wait till the warm-up's underway
Wait till our lips have met
And wait till you see that sunshine day
You ain't seen nothin' yet

The best is yet to come and babe, won't it be fine?
Best is yet to come, come the day you're mine

Come the day you're mine
I'm gonna teach you to fly
We've only tasted the wine
We're gonna drain the cup dry

Wait till your charms are right for these arms to surround
You think you've flown before, but baby, you ain't left the ground

A-Wait till you're locked in my embrace
Wait till I draw you near
A-Wait till you see that sunshine place
Ain't nothin' like it here

The best is yet to come and babe, won't it be fine?
The best is yet to come, come the day you're mine

Come the day you're mine
And you're gonna be mine

All or nothing at all
Half a love, never appealed to me
If your heart, never could yield to me
Then I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

All or nothing at all
If it's love, there is no in between
Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may go dizzy and fall

And if I fell (I fell) under the spell of your call
I would be, caught in the undertow
So you see, I've got to say no, no
All or nothing at all
</song>
