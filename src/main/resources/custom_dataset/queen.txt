[Intro]
Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me

[Verse 1]
Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

[Verse 2]
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh (Any way the wind blows)
I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

[Verse 3]
I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightning me
(Galileo) Galileo, (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro magnifico
But I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go) Ah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Oh, mamma mia, mamma mia) Mamma mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me!

[Verse 4]
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here!

[Outro]
Nothing really matters, anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me
Any way the wind blows

[Verse 1]
Love of my life, you've hurt me
You've broken my heart, and now you leave me

[Pre-Chorus]
Love of my life, can't you see?

[Chorus]
Bring it back, bring it back, don't take it away from me
Because you don't know what it means to me

[Verse 2]
Love of my life, don't leave me
You've stolen my love, and now desert me

[Pre-Chorus]
Love of my life, can't you see?

[Chorus]
Bring it back, bring it back, don't take it away from me
Because you don't know what it means to me

[Bridge]
You will remember, when this is blown over
And everything's all by the way
When I grow older, I will be there at your side
To remind you how I still love you (I still love you)

[Chorus]
Back, hurry back, please bring it back home to me
Because you don't know what it means to me

[Outro]
Love of my life
Love of my life
Ooh, ooh
</song>
<song>
[Intro]
Tonight I'm gonna have myself a real good time
I feel alive
And the world, I'll turn it inside out, yeah
I'm floating around in ecstasy
So don't stop me now
Don't stop me
‘Cause I'm having a good time, having a good time

[Verse 1]
I'm a shooting star leaping through the sky
Like a tiger defying the laws of gravity
I'm a racing car passing by like Lady Godiva
I'm gonna go, go, go, there's no stopping me

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm burning through the sky, yeah
Two hundred degrees, that's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm travelling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic man outta you

[Chorus]
Don't stop me now
I'm having such a good time
I'm having a ball
Don't stop me now
If you wanna have a good time
Just give me a call
Don't stop me now, ‘cause I'm having a good time
Don't stop me now, yes, I'm having a good time
I don't wanna stop at all, yeah

[Verse 2]
I'm a rocket ship on my way to Mars on a collision course
I am a satellite, I'm out of control
I'm a sex machine ready to reload
Like an atom bomb about to, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, explode!

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm burning through the sky, yeah
Two hundred degrees, that's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm travelling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic woman of you

[Bridge]
Don't stop me, don't stop me, don't stop me (Hey, hey, hey!)
Don't stop me, don't stop me, ooh, ooh, ooh (I like it!)
Don't stop me, don't stop me (Have a good time, good time)
Don't stop me, don't stop me, aah
Let loose, honey, all right

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm burning through the sky, yeah
Two hundred degrees, that's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit (Hey!)
Travelling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic man outta you (Yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
Don't stop me now
I'm having such a good time
I'm having a ball
Don't stop me now
If you wanna have a good time (Ooh, alright)
Just give me a call
Don't stop me now, ‘cause I'm having a good time (Yeah, yeah)
Don't stop me now, yes, I'm having a good time
I don't wanna stop at all

[Outro]
Ah, da da da da
Da da ah ah
Ah da da, ah ah ah

[Verse 1]
She keeps a Moët et Chandon in her pretty cabinet
Let them eat cake she says, just like Marie Antoinette
A built-in remedy for Khrushchev and Kennedy (Ooh, ooh)
At anytime an invitation, you can't decline (Ooh, ooh)
Caviar and cigarettes, well versed in etiquette
Extraordinarily nice

[Chorus]
She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind (Pa-pa-pa-pa)
(Anytime)
Ooh
Recommended at the price
Insatiable an appetite
Wanna try?

[Verse 2]
To avoid complications, she never kept the same address
In conversation, she spoke just like a baroness
Met a man from China, went down to Geisha Minah (Ooh, ooh)
(Killer, killer, she's a killer Queen)
Then again incidentally, if you're that way inclined
Perfume came naturally from Paris (Naturally)
For cars, she couldn't care less
Fastidious and precise

[Chorus]
She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
(Pa-pa-pa-pa)
Anytime

[Bridge]
Drop of a hat she's as willing as playful as a pussy cat
(Ooh)
Then momentarily out of action (Ooh,)
Temporarily out of gas (Ta-taaa)
To absolutely drive (You wild, wild)
She's all out to get you

[Chorus]
She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam (Pa-pa-pa-ra)
Guaranteed to blow your mind
(Anytime)
Ooh
Recommended at the price
Insatiable an appetite
Wanna try?

[Outro]
Wanna try?

[Verse 1]
Steve walks warily down the street
With the brim pulled way down low
Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet
Machine guns ready to go
Are you ready? Hey, are you ready for this?
Are you hanging on the edge of your seat?
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat, yeah

[Chorus]
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust, yeah
Hey, I'm gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust

[Verse 2]
How do you think I'm going to get along
Without you, when you're gone
You took me for everything that I had
And kicked me out on my own
Are you happy, are you satisfied?
How long can you stand the heat?
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat
Look out

[Chorus]
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I'm gonna get you, too
Another one bites the dust


[Bridge]
Hey
Oh, take it
Bite the dust, hey
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust, ow
Another one bites the dust, hey hey
Another one bites the dust, hey-eh-eh
Ooh

[Verse 3]
There are plenty of ways you can hurt a man
And bring him to the ground
You can beat him, you can cheat him, you can treat him bad
And leave him when he's down, yeah
But I'm ready, yes I'm ready for you
I'm standing on my own two feet
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
Repeating the sound of the beat
Oh yeah

[Chorus]
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust, yeah
Hey, I'm gonna get you, too
Another one bites the dust

[Verse 1]
Buddy, you're a boy, make a big noise
Playing in the street, gonna be a big man someday
You got mud on your face, you big disgrace
Kicking your can all over the place, singing

[Chorus]
We will, we will rock you
We will, we will rock you

[Verse 2]
Buddy, you're a young man, hard man
Shouting in the street, gonna take on the world someday
You got blood on your face, you big disgrace
Waving your banner all over the place

[Chorus]
We will, we will rock you
Sing it out
We will, we will rock you

[Verse 3]
Buddy, you're an old man, poor man
Pleading with your eyes, gonna make you some peace someday
You got mud on your face, big disgrace
Somebody better put you back into your place

[Chorus]
We will, we will rock you, sing it
We will, we will rock you, everybody
We will, we will rock you, hmm
We will, we will rock you, alright
</song>
<song>
[Verse 1]
I'd sit alone and watch your light
My only friend through teenage nights
And everything I had to know
I heard it on my radio
You gave them all those old time stars
Through wars of worlds invaded by Mars
You made them laugh, you made them cry
You made us feel like we could fly (Radio)
So don't become some background noise
A backdrop for the girls and boys
Who just don't know or just don't care
And just complain when you're not there

[Pre-Chorus]
You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio (Radio)

[Chorus]
All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio goo goo
Radio ga ga
All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio blah blah
Radio, what's new?
Radio, someone still loves you

[Verse 2]
We watch the shows, we watch the stars
On videos for hours and hours
We hardly need to use our ears
How music changes through the years
Let's hope you never leave, old friend
Like all good things on you we depend
So stick around 'cause we might miss you
When we grow tired of all this visual

[Pre-Chorus]
You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio (Radio)

[Chorus]
All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio goo goo
Radio ga ga
All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio goo goo
Radio ga ga
All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio blah blah
Radio, what's new?
Someone still loves you!

[Bridge]
(Radio ga ga Radio ga ga)
(Radio ga ga Radio ga ga)
(Radio ga ga Radio ga ga)

[Outro]
You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio (Radio)

[Verse 1]
I've paid my dues
Time after time
I've done my sentence
But committed no crime
And bad mistakes
I've made a few
I've had my share of sand kicked in my face
But I've come through
(And I need to go on and on, and on, and on)

[Chorus]
We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting till the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions
Of the world

[Verse 2]
I've taken my bows
And my curtain calls
You brought me fame and fortune and everything that goes with it
I thank you all
But it's been no bed of roses
No pleasure cruise
I consider it a challenge before the whole human race
And I ain't gonna lose
(And I need just go on and on, and on, and on)

[Chorus]
We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting till the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions
Of the world

[Outro]
We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting till the end, oh
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions...
</song>
<song>
[Verse 1]
Empty spaces, what are we living for?
Abandoned places, I guess we know the score, on and on
Does anybody know what we are looking for?
Another hero, another mindless crime
Behind the curtain, in the pantomime
Hold the line
Does anybody want to take it anymore?

[Chorus]
The show must go on
The show must go on, yeah
Inside my heart is breaking
My makeup may be flaking
But my smile, still, stays on

[Verse 2]
Whatever happens, I'll leave it all to chance
Another heartache, another failed romance, on and on
Does anybody know what we are living for?
I guess I'm learning
I must be warmer now
I'll soon be turning, round the corner now
Outside the dawn is breaking
But inside in the dark I'm aching to be free

[Chorus]
The show must go on
The show must go on
Inside my heart is breaking
My makeup may be flaking
But my smile, still, stays on

[Bridge]
My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies
Fairy tales of yesterday, grow but never die
I can fly, my friends

[Chorus]
The show must go on
The show must go on
I'll face it with a grin
I'm never giving in
On with the show

[Verse 3]
I'll top the bill
I'll overkill
I have to find the will to carry on
On with the show
Show must go on
Show must go on

Are you gonna take me home tonight?
Oh, down beside that red firelight?
Are you gonna let it all hang out?
Fat bottomed girls, you make the rockin' world go 'round

[Verse 1]
Hey!
I was just a skinny lad, never knew no good from bad
But I knew life before I left my nursery, huh
Left alone with big fat Fanny, she was such a naughty nanny
Hey, big woman, you made a bad boy out of me
Hey, hey
Woo!

[Verse 2]
I've been singing with my band, 'cross the water, 'cross the land
I've seen every blue eyed floozy on the way
But their beauty and their style went kinda smooth after a while
Take me to them dirty ladies every time
Come on

Oh, won't you take me home tonight
Oh, down beside your red firelight?
Oh, and you give it all you got

Get on your bikes and ride!

You're so self-satisfied, I don't need you

God knows, God knows I want to break free

[Verse 2]
I've fallen in love
I've fallen in love for the first time
And this time I know it's for real
I've fallen in love, yeah
God knows, God knows I've fallen in love

[Bridge]
It's strange but it's true, yeah
I can't get over the way you love me like you do
But I have to be sure
When I walk out that door
Oh, how I want to be free, baby
Oh, how I want to be free
Oh, how I want to break free

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
But life still goes on
I can't get used to living without, living without
Living without you by my side
I don't want to live alone, hey
God knows, got to make it on my own
So baby, can't you see?
I've got to break free

Here we stand or here we fall
History won't care at all
Make the bed, light the light yeah
Lady Mercy won't be home tonight, yeah

[Chorus]
You don't waste no time at all
Don't hear the bell but you answer the call
It comes to you as to us all
We're just waiting for the hammer to fall, yeah

[Verse 2]
Oh, every night and every day
A little piece of you is falling away
But lift your face, the Western Way
Build your muscles as your body decays, yeah

[Chorus]
Tow the line and play their game
Yeah, let the anesthetic cover it all
Until one day they call your name
You know it's time for the hammer to fall

[Bridge]
Rich or poor or famous
For your truth is all the same (Oh no, oh no)
Oh, lock your door but rain is pouring
Through your window pane (Oh no)
Baby, baby, now your struggle is all in vain

[Verse 4]
For we who grew up tall and proud
In the shadow of the Mushroom Cloud
Convinced our voices can't be heard
We just wanna scream it louder and louder and louder

[Chorus]
What the hell are we fighting for?
Oh, just surrender and it won't hurt at all
You just got time to say your prayers
While you are waiting for the hammer to, hammer to fall

[Outro]
Hey, it's...
It's gonna fall
Hammer, you know
Yeah, hammer to fall

Ooh, you make me live now, honey
Ooh, you make me live

There's no time for us
There's no place for us
What is this thing that builds our dreams
Yet slips away from us?

[Chorus]
Who wants to live forever?
Who wants to live forever? Ooh...

[Verse 2]
There's no chance for us
It's all decided for us
This world has only one sweet moment
Set aside for us

Who wants to live forever?
Who wants to live forever? Ooh...

[Post-Chorus]
Who dares to love forever
Oh, when love must die?

But touch my tears with your lips
Touch my world with your fingertips
And we can have forever
And we can love forever
Forever is our today

Who wants to live forever?
Who wants to live forever?

Forever is our today
Who waits forever anyway?

[Verse 1]
I can dim the lights and sing you songs full of sad things
We can do the tango, just for two
I can serenade and gently play on your heart strings
Be a Valentino, just for you

[Chorus]
"Ooh love, Ooh lover boy
What're you doing tonight? Hey boy"
Set my alarm, turn on my charm
That's because I'm a good old-fashioned lover boy

[Verse 2]
Ooh, let me feel your heartbeat (grow faster, faster)
Ooh, can you feel my love heat? (Ohh)
Come on and sit on my hot-seat of love
And tell me how do you feel right after-all
I'd like for you and I to go romancing
Say the word, your wish is my command

[Chorus]
“Ooh love, Ooh lover boy
What’re you doing tonight? Hey boy”
Write my letter, feel much better
I’ll use my fancy patter on the telephone

[Bridge]
When I'm not with you
Think of you always
I miss you (I miss those long hot summer nights)
When I'm not with you
Think of me always
Love you, Love you
Hey boy where do you get it from?
Hey boy where did you go?
I learned my passion in the good old fashioned
School of lover boys

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Dining at the Ritz we'll meet at nine (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 o'clock) precisely
I will pay the bill, you taste the wine
Driving back in style, in my saloon will do quite nicely
Just take me back to yours, that will be fine (Come on and get it)

[Chorus]
"Ooh love (there he goes again)
Ooh lover boy (who's my good old-fashioned lover boy? ooh ooh)
What're you doing tonight, hey boy"
Everything's all right, just hold on tight
That's because I'm a good old-fashioned (fashioned) lover boy

[Intro: Queen]
I want it all (Hey, yeah), I want it all
I want it all, and I want it now

[Verse 1: Freddie Mercury]
Adventure seeker on an empty street
Just an alley creeper light on his feet
A young fighter screaming with no time for doubt
With the pain and anger, can't see a way out

[Pre-Chorus: Freddie Mercury]
"It ain't much I'm asking," I heard him say
"Got to find me a future, move out of my way"

[Chorus: Queen]
I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, and I want it now
I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, and I want it now

[Verse 2: Freddie Mercury]
Listen, all you people, come gather 'round
I gotta get me a game plan, gotta shake you to the ground
Just give me what I know is mine
People, do you hear me? Just give me the sign

[Pre-Chorus: Freddie Mercury]
It ain't much I'm asking, if you want the truth
Here's to the future for the dreams of youth

[Chorus: Queen]
I want it all, I want it all (Give it all, I want it all)
I want it all, and I want it now (Hey)
I want it all, I want it all (Yes, I want it all, hey)
I want it all, and I want it now

[Bridge: Brian May (and Freddie Mercury)]
I'm a man with a one-track mind
So much to do in one lifetime (People, do you hear me?)
Not a man for compromise
And 'wheres' and 'whys' and living lies
So I'm living it all (Yes, I'm living it all)
And I'm giving it all (And I'm giving it all, ooh, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Freddie Mercury]
It ain't much I'm asking, if you want the truth
Here's to the future, hear the cry of youth
(Hear the cry, hear the cry of youth)

[Chorus: Queen]
I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, and I want it now
I want it all, I want it all (Hey, yeah, yeah)
I want it all, and I want it now (Ooh, ooh)
I want it now

[Outro: Freddie Mercury]
I want it, I want it!
Oooh, huh!
</song>
<song>
[Verse 1]
It started off so well
They said we made a perfect pair
I clothed myself in your glory and your love
How I loved you, how I cried
The years of care and loyalty
Were nothing but a sham, it seems
The years belie, we lived a lie
I love you 'til I die

[Chorus]
Save me, save me, save me
I can't face this life alone
Save me, save me, save me
I'm naked and I'm far from home

[Verse 2]
The slate will soon be clean
I’ll erase the memories
To start again with somebody new
Was it all wasted, all that love?
I hang my head and I advertise
A soul for sale or rent
I have no heart, I am cold inside
I have no real intent

[Chorus]
Save me, save me, save me
I can't face this life alone
Save me, save me, oh
I'm naked and I'm far from home

[Verse 3]
Each night I cry, I still believe the lie
I love you 'til I die
Ow!

[Outro]
Save me, save me, save me (Oh yeah!)
Yeah, save me, save me, ooh (Oh, save me)
Don't let me face my life alone
Save me, save me, ooh
I'm naked and I'm far from home
</song>
