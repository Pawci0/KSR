[Verse 1]
Wise men say
Only fools rush in
But I can't help falling in love with you
Shall I stay?
Would it be a sin?
If I can't help falling in love with you

[Chorus]
Like a river flows
Surely to the sea
Darling, so it goes
Some things are meant to be

[Verse 2]
Take my hand
Take my whole life too
For I can't help falling in love with you

[Chorus]
Like a river flows
Surely to the sea
Darling, so it goes
Some things are meant to be

[Verse 3]
Take my hand
Take my whole life, too
For I can't help falling in love with you
For I can't help falling in love with you

[Verse 1:]
The warden threw a party in the county jail
The prison band was there and they began to wail
The band was jumping and the joint began to swing
You should've heard those knocked out jailbirds sing

[Chorus:]
Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock

[Verse 2:]
Spider Murphy played the tenor saxophone
Little Joe was blowing on the slide trombone
The drummer boy from Illinois went crash, boom, bang
The whole rhythm section was the Purple Gang

[Chorus:]
Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock

[Verse 3:]
Number forty-seven said to number three
"You're the cutest jailbird I ever did see
I sure would be delighted with your company
Come on and do the Jailhouse Rock with me"

[Chorus:]
Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock

[Verse 4:]
The sad sack was a sitting on a block of stone
Way over in the corner weeping all alone
The warden said, "Hey, buddy, don't you be no square
If you can't find a partner use a wooden chair"

[Chorus:]
Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock

[Verse 5:]
Shifty Henry said to Bugs, "For Heaven's sake
No one's looking, now's our chance to make a break"
Bugsy turned to Shifty and he said, "Nix nix
I want to stick around a while and get my kicks."

[Chorus:]
Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock

[Outro]
Dancing to the Jailhouse Rock
Dancing to the Jailhouse Rock
Dancing to the Jailhouse Rock
Dancing to the Jailhouse Rock

[Verse 1]
Love me tender
Love me sweet
Never let me go
You have made my life complete
And I love you so

[Verse 2]
Love me tender
Love me true
All my dreams fulfilled
For my darling I love you
And I always will

[Verse 3]
Love me tender
Love me long
Take me to your heart
For it's there that I belong
And we'll never part

[Verse 4]
Love me tender
Love me dear
Tell me you are mine
I'll be yours through all the years
Till the end of time

[Verse 5]
(When at last my dreams come true
Darling this I know
Happiness will follow you
Everywhere you go)

[Verse 1]
You ain't nothing but a hound dog
Crying all the time
You ain't nothing but a hound dog
Crying all the time
Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit
And you ain't no friend of mine

[Verse 2]
When they said you was high classed
Well, that was just a lie
When they said you was high classed
Well, that was just a lie
You ain't never caught a rabbit
And you ain't no friend of mine

Ahhhhhhhhhh (ahhhh)
Ahhhhhhhhhh (ahhhh)

[Verse 2]
When they said you was high classed
Well, that was just a lie
When they said you was high classed
Well, that was just a lie
You ain't never caught a rabbit
And you ain't no friend of mine

[Verse 1]
You ain't nothing but a hound dog
Crying all the time
You ain't nothing but a hound dog
Crying all the time
Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit
And you ain't no friend of mine

[Verse 1]
Well, since my baby left me
Well, I found a new place to dwell
Well, it's down at the end of lonely street
At Heartbreak Hotel

[Chorus]
You make me so lonely baby
Well, I'm so lonely
I get so lonely I could die

[Verse 2]
Although it's always crowded
You still can find some room
For broken hearted lovers
To cry away their gloom
And be so

[Chorus]
You make me so lonely baby
Well, I'm so lonely
I get so lonely I could die

[Verse 3]
Now the bell hops tears keep flowing
The desk clerks dressed in black
Well they've been so long on lonely street
They'll never look back

[Chorus]
You make me so lonely baby
Well, I'm so lonely
I get so lonely I could die

[Verse 4]
Hey now, if your baby leaves you
And you got a tale to tell
Just take a walk down lonely street
To Heartbreak Hotel
</song>
<song>
[Verse 1]
Oh, my love, my darling
I've hungered for your touch, a long lonely time
And time goes by, so slowly and time can do so much
Are you, still mine?
I need your love, I need your love
Godspeed your love to me

[Verse 2]
Lonely rivers flow to the sea, to the sea
To the waiting arms of the sea
Lonely rivers cry, wait for me, wait for me
To the open arms, wait for me

[Verse 3]
My love, my darling, I've hungered for your kiss
Are you still mine?
I need your love, I need your love
Godspeed your love, to me
</song>
<song>
[Verse 1]
Are you lonesome tonight?
Do you miss me tonight?
Are you sorry we drifted apart?
Does your memory stray
To a bright sunny day
When I kissed you and called you sweetheart?

[Verse 2]
Do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare?
Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there?
Is your heart filled with pain
Shall I come back again?
Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight?

Spoken:
I wonder if you're lonesome tonight
You know someone said that the world's a stage
And each of us must play a part
Fate had me playing in love with you as my sweetheart
Act one was where we met
I loved you at first glance
You read your line so cleverly and never missed a cue
Then came act two, you seemed to changed, you acted strange
And why I've never know
Honey, you lied when you said you loved me
And I had no cause to doubt you
But I'd rather go on hearing your lies
Than to go on living without you
Now the stage is bare and I'm standing there
With emptiness all around
And if you won't come back to me
Then they can bring the curtain down

[Outro]
Is your heart filled with pain
Shall I come back again?
Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight?

[Verse 1]
We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much baby

Why can't you see
What you're doing to me
When you don't believe a word I say?

[Chorus]
We can't go on together
With suspicious minds
And we can't build our dreams
On suspicious minds

[Verse 2]
So, if an old friend I know
Stops by to say hello
Would I still see suspicion in your eyes?

Here we go again
Asking where I've been
You can't see the tears are real, I'm crying
(Yes, I'm crying)

[Chorus]
We can't go on together
With suspicious minds
And we can't build our dreams
On suspicious minds

[Bridge]
Oh let our love survive
I'll dry the tears from your eyes
Let's don't let a good thing die
When honey, you know I've never lied to you
Mmm yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much baby

Why can't you see
What you're doing to me
When you don't believe a word I say?

[Outro]
Well, don't you know I'm caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much baby
Well, don't you know I'm caught in a trap
We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much baby
Well, don't you know I'm caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much baby
Well, don't you know I'm caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much baby
Well, don't you know I'm caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much baby...

[Intro]
Well, it's one for the money, two for the show
Three to get ready, now go, cat, go

[Chorus]
But don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Well, you can do anything, but stay off of my blue suede shoes

[Verse 1]
Well, you can knock me down, step in my face
Slander my name all over the place
Do anything that you wanna do
But uh-uh honey, lay off of them shoes

[Chorus]
And don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Well, you can do anything, but stay off of my blue suede shoes
Let's go, cat!
Ah, walk the dog

[Verse 2]
You can burn my house, steal my car
Drink my liquor from an old fruit jar
Do anything that you want to do
But uh-uh, honey, lay off of my shoes

[Chorus]
And don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Well, you can do anything, but lay off of my blue suede shoes
Rock it
Yeah!

[Bridge]
Well, it's one for the money, two for the show
Three to get ready, now go, go, go

But don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Well, you can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes

Blue, blue, blue suede shoes
Well, you can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes

[Verse 1]
I can't stop loving you
So I've made up my mind
To live in memory
Of such an old lonesome time

[Verse 2]
I can't stop wanting you
It's useless to say
So I'll just live my life
In dreams of yesterday

[Verse 3]
Those happy hours
That we once knew
Though long ago
They still make me blue

[Verse 4]
They say that time
Heals a broken heart
But time has stood still
Since we've been apart
</song>
<song>
[Verse 1]
You know I can be found
Sitting home all alone
If you can't come around
At least please telephone
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true

[Verse 2]
Baby, if I made you mad
For something I might have said
Please, let's forget the past
The future looks bright ahead
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
I don't want no other love
Baby it's just you I'm thinking of

[Verse 3]
Don't stop thinking of me
Don't make me feel this way
Come on over here and love me
You know what I want you to say
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
Why should we be apart?
I really love you baby, cross my heart

[Verse 4]
Let's walk up to the preacher
And let us say I do
Then you'll know you'll have me
And I'll know that I'll have you
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
I don't want no other love
Baby it's just you I'm thinking of

[Verse 5]
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
I don't want no other love
Baby it's just you I'm thinking of

[Verse 1]
As the snow flies
On a cold and gray Chicago morning
A poor little baby child is born
In the ghetto
And his mama cries
Cause if there's one thing that she don't need
It's another little hungry mouth to feed
In the ghetto

[Verse 2]
People, don't you understand
A child needs a helping hand
Or he'll grow to be an angry young man some day
Take a look at you and me
Are we too blind to see
Do we simply turn our heads
And look the other way

[Verse 3]
Well the world turns
And a hungry little boy with a runny nose
Plays in the street as the cold wind blows
In the ghetto

[Verse 4]
And his hunger burns
So he starts to roam the streets at night
And he learns how to steal
And he learns how to fight
In the ghetto

[Verse 5]
Then one night in desperation
A young man breaks away
He buys a gun, He steals a car
Tries to run, but he don't get far
And his mama cries

[Bridge]
As a crowd gathers 'round an angry young man
Face down on the street with a gun in his hand
In the ghetto

[Verse 6]
And as her young man dies
On a cold and gray Chicago morning
Another little baby child is born
In the ghetto

And his mama cries
In the ghetto

[Verse 1]
You can shake an apple off an apple tree
Shake-a, shake- sugar
But you'll never shake me
Uh-uh-uh
No-sir-ee, uh, uh
I'm going to stick like glue
Stick because I'm
Stuck on you

[Verse 2]
Going to run my fingers thru your long black hair
Squeeze you tighter than a grizzly bear
Uh-uh-uh
Yes-sir-ee, uh, uh
I'm going to stick like glue
Stick, because I'm
Stuck on you

[Verse 3]
Hide in the kitchen, hide in the hall
Ain't going to do you no good at all
Because once I catch you and the kissing starts
A team of wild horses couldn't tear us apart

[Verse 4]
Try to take a tiger from his daddy's side
That's how love is going to keep us tied
Uh-uh-uh
Yes-sir-ee, uh, uh
I'm gonna stick like glue
Stick, because I'm
Stuck on you

[Verse 1]
Lord Almighty
I feel my temperature rising
Higher higher
It's burning through to my soul
Girl, girl, girl
You going to set me on fire
My brain is flaming
I don't know which way to go

[Chorus]
Your kisses lift me higher
Like the sweet song of a choir
You light my morning sky
With burning love

[Verse 2]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I feel my temperature rising
Help me, I'm flaming
I must be a hundred and nine
Burning, burning, burning
And nothing can cool me
I just might turn into smoke
But I feel fine

[Chorus]
Because your kisses lift me higher
Like a sweet song of a choir
And you light my morning sky
With burning love

[Verse 3]
It's coming closer
The flames are now licking my body
Won't you help me
I feel like I'm slipping away
It's hard to breathe
And my chest is a-heaving
Lord, have mercy
I'm burning a hole where I lay

[Chorus]
Your kisses lift me higher
Like the sweet song of a choir
You light my morning sky
With burning love
With burning love
(Ah, ah, burning love)

[Outro]
I'm just a hunk, a hunk of burning love
Just a hunk, a hunk of burning love
Just a hunk, a hunk of burning love
Just a hunk, a hunk of burning love
Just a hunk, a hunk of burning love
Just a hunk, a hunk of burning love
Just a hunk, a hunk of burning love
Just a hunk, a hunk of burning love
Just a hunk, a hunk of burning love
Just a hunk, a hunk of burning love
Just a hunk, a hunk of burning love

[Verse 1]
I'll have a Blue Christmas without you
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
I'll be so blue just thinking about you
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
(Ahh, ahh)
Won't be the same dear, if you're not here with me
(Ooh)

[Verse 2]
And when those blue snowflakes start fallin'
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
That's when those blue memories start callin'
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
You'll be doin' all right, with your Christmas of white
(Ahh, ahh)
But I'll have a blue, blue, blue, blue Christmas

[Bridge]
(Oooooaaaooooh

But I'll have a blue, blue, blue, blue Christmas

[Verse 1]
Treat me like a fool
Treat me mean and cruel
But love me
Wring my faithful heart
Tear it all apart
But love me

[Verse 2]
If you ever go
Darling, I'll be oh so lonely
I'll be sad and blue
Crying over you, dear only

[Chorus]
I would beg and steal
(Beg and steal)
Just to feel
(Just to feel)
Your heart
(I want your heart)
Beating close to mine
(So close to mine)

[Verse 3]
Well, if you ever go
Darling, I'll be oh so lonely
I'll be sad and blue
Crying over you, dear only

[Chorus]
I would beg and steal
(He would beg and steal)
Just to feel
(Yes, just to feel)
Your heart
(I want your heart)
Beating close to mine
(So close to mine)

[Verse 4]
Well, if you ever go
Darling, I'll be oh so lonely
Beggin' on my knees
All I ask is please, please love me
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
Uh, well, a-bless my soul
What's wrong with me?
I'm itching like a man on a fuzzy tree
My friends say I'm actin' wild as a bug

[Chorus]
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Mm mm oh, oh, yeah, yeah!

[Verse 2]
Well, my hands are shaky and my knees are weak
I can't seem to stand on my own two feet
Who do you thank when you have such luck?

[Chorus]
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Mm mm oh, oh, yeah, yeah!

[Bridge 1]
Well, please don't ask me what's on my mind
I'm a little mixed up, but I feel fine
When I'm near the girl that I love best
My heart beats so it scares me to death!

[Verse 3]
When she touched my hand, what a chill I got
Her lips are like a volcano that's hot
I'm proud to say that she's my buttercup

[Chorus]
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Mm mm oh, oh, yeah, yeah!

[Bridge 2]
My tongue gets tied when I try to speak
My insides shake like a leaf on a tree
There's only one cure for this body of mine
That's to have that girl that I love so fine!

[Verse 3]
She touched my hand, what a chill I got
Her lips are like a volcano that's hot
I'm proud to say that she's my buttercup

[Chorus]
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Mm mm oh, oh, yeah, yeah!
Mm mm oh, oh, yeah, yeah!
I'm all shook up

[Verse 1]
Maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should have
Maybe I didn't love you
Quite as often as I could have

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time

[Chorus]
You were always on my mind
(You were always on my mind)
You were always on my mind

[Verse 2]
Maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely, lonely times
And I guess I never told you
I'm so happy that you're mine

[Pre-Chorus 2]
If I make you feel second best
Girl, I'm so sorry I was blind

[Chorus]
You were always on my mind
(You were always on my mind)
You were always on my mind

[Bridge]
Tell me
Tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
Give me
Give me one more chance to keep you satisfied, satisfied

[Pre-Chorus]
Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time

[Chorus]
You were always on my mind
(You were always on my mind)
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

[Outro]
Maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should have
Maybe I didn't love you
Quite as often as I could have
Maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely, lonely times
And I guess I never told you...

[Chorus]
A little less conversation, a little more action please
All this aggravation ain't satisfactioning me
A little more bite and a little less bark
A little less fight and a little more spark
Close your mouth and open up your heart and baby satisfy me
Satisfy me baby

[Verse 1]
Baby close your eyes and listen to the music
Drifting through a summer breeze
It's a groovy night and I can show you how to use it
Come along with me and put your mind at ease

[Chorus]
A little less conversation, a little more action please
All this aggravation ain't satisfactioning me
A little more bite and a little less bark
A little less fight and a little more spark
Close your mouth and open up your heart and baby satisfy me
Satisfy me baby

[Verse 2]
Come on baby I'm tired of talking
Grab your coat and let's start walking
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Don't procrastinate, don't articulate
Girl it's getting late, gettin' upset waitin' around

[Chorus]
A little less conversation, a little more action please
All this aggravation ain't satisfactioning me
A little more bite and a little less bark
A little less fight and a little more spark
Close your mouth and open up your heart and baby satisfy me
Satisfy me baby
Satisfy me baby
Satisfy me baby
Satisfy me baby
Satisfy me

[Chorus]
It's now or never
Come hold me tight
Kiss me my darling
Be mine tonight
Tomorrow will be too late
It's now or never
My love won't wait

[Verse 1]
When I first saw you
With your smile so tender
My heart was captured
My soul surrendered
I'd spend a lifetime
Waiting for the right time
Now that you're near
The time is here at last

[Chorus]
It's now or never
Come hold me tight
Kiss me my darling
Be mine tonight
Tomorrow will be too late
It's now or never
My love won't wait

[Verse 2]
Just like a willow
We would cry an ocean
If we lost true love
And sweet devotion
Your lips excite me
Let your arms invite me
For who knows when
We'll meet again this way

[Chorus]
It's now or never
Come hold me tight
Kiss me my darling
Be mine tonight
Tomorrow will be too late
It's now or never
My love won't wait
It's now or never
My love won't wait
It's now or never
My love won't wait
It's now or never
My love won't wait
